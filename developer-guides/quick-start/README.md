# Quick start for code developers

## On Linux/Mac

You can run Rocket.Chat for development on a Linux or a Mac. The following instruction has been tested on a new Ubuntu 18.04 LTS installation.    Try to find and use a *NEW Ubuntu server installation* with no other un-necessary software installed, not a "Desktop" or "Client" installation.

*DO NOT* use a system where you already have nodeJS installed to avoid problems.

During the build, memory usage will be nearly 8G, this is the minimum level of RAM recommended for development workstations.  (If you are not doing any development, and just deploying a Rocket.Chat server - the RAM required can be as low as 1G.)

IMPORTANT:  Note that there is no need to install mongo, nodejs, or npm on the base operating system.  If you have any of these already installed; start over, or use another CLEAN system.

Perform the Development under a regular user account (not `root`) on Linux.  Do not run `sudo` at all.   Running `sudo` even once  during the installation -- may mess up file permissions in irreversable manner.

You may notice build WARNINGs related to _peer dependencies_  or other transitive dependencies.  They are typically safe to ignore unless you are coding the feature or modules that require them.

1. Install tools required

    `sudo apt install g++ build-essential git curl python-minimal`

2. Install meteor

    `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

   (Under some circumstances, you may need to install a specific (older) release of Meteor instead of the latest, always check the `.meteor/release` file of the Github code repository to determine if you need to do this before you install meteor)

    You do not need to install `node` or `npm`, as meteor already includes them.  Verify by:

    `meteor node -v`

    `meteor npm -v`

3. Get rocket.chat code

    `git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.git`

4. Install modules

    `cd Rocket.Chat`

    `meteor npm install`

5. Start building (the first build can *take 30 or more minutes*, and you may see various warnings or minor errors --  please be patient;  subsequent dev builds after the first will be 5 minutes or less)

    `meteor npm start`

When the server is ready, the following sample is observed with "Server Running" title:

This means that a Rocket.Chat server is running from your Computer. To access the server, navigate to

`http://localhost:3000`

### Editing Rocket.Chat Files

Editing files is relatively simple. After you run `git clone`, the files from the repository are saved on
your Computer. You can go to the cloned repository folder and edit or add files to Rocket.Chat.
When you make the changes to Rocket.Chat, the server will automatically rebuild.

Sometimes, changes can shutdown the server. If that happens, run `meteor npm start` again.

## On Windows

Using Windows to develop is not recommended, instead is better to create a Linux virtual machine and follow the steps mentioned above, but if for some reason you really need to build Rocket.Chat on Windows, you can find a community supported guide over [here](../../installation/community-supported-installation/windows-server/).
